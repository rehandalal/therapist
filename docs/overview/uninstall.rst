Uninstallation
==============

If you decide you no longer want to use the Therapist pre-commit hook, simply
run:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ therapist uninstall

.. note:: This will remove any pre-commit hook that is installed. It does not check to verify that it is the Therapist pre-commit hook.
